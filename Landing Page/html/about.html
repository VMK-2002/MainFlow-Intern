            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>At GreenRoots Organic Farm, we're passionate about growing food
                 the way nature intended — pure, chemical-free, and full of life.
                  What began as a small patch of land and a big dream has grown into 
                  a thriving organic farm rooted in sustainability, health, and community.
                <br> We believe that healthy soil grows healthy food, which nourishes
                 healthy people. That's why we use 100% natural methods, from composting
                  and crop rotation to companion planting and water conservation. 
                  No synthetic pesticides. No GMOs. Just honest, earth-friendly farming.
                <br>Our farm is more than a business — it's a way of life. Every fruit, 
                vegetable, and herb we grow is nurtured with care and harvested with purpose,
                 ensuring you get the freshest, most nutritious produce possible.
